Cluttered Couch
===============

Generates CouchDB documents based on a size that you specify in bytes. The
internals of the document don't really matter, but you can configure a field
name and the document's _id.

This is especially useful for automated testing systems where you care about
the size of the document, not its contents.

Functions
---------

1. clutteredCouch.single(opts);

Returns: Buffer

opts = {
  size: <byte including JSON markup>,
  id: <optional, the doc's _id>,
  fieldName: <optional, string for the field name>
};

id defaults to null, causing couchdb to generate an _id
fieldName defaults to "bwah"

2. clutteredCouch.many(num, opts);

Returns: Array of Buffer classes

Takes the number of documents to generate (`num`) and the options to generate
the documents with (passed to `clutteredCouch.single()`).

num defaults to 10
opts defaults to { size: 1000 }
